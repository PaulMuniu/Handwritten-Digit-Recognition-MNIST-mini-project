## Handwritten Digit Recognition (MNIST) Project.

### Project Description

This project aims to develop a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to accurately classify handwritten digits from the MNIST dataset. The MNIST dataset contains images of handwritten digits (0 through 9) and is a classic benchmark dataset for machine learning models. The goal is to build a model that can correctly identify the digit in each image with high accuracy.

### Features

- **Convolutional Neural Network (CNN)**: Utilizes CNN layers for feature extraction and classification.
- **Model Evaluation**: Evaluates the model's performance on a test set.
- **Saving the Model**: Saves the trained model for future predictions.

### Requirements

- Python 3.x
- TensorFlow 2.x
- NumPy
- Matplotlib (optional, for visualization)

The CNN model consists of:
- **Convolutional Layers**: Extract features from the images.
- **Pooling Layers**: Reduce dimensionality.
- **Fully Connected Layers**: Classify the features.
- **Output Layer**: Softmax activation for digit classification.

### Results
The model achieves high accuracy on the MNIST test set. The final accuracy and other metrics will be displayed after training.
